# Credit Card Fraud Detection
A project using machine learning classification algorithms to detect credit card fraud in a dataset of over 280,000 transactions.


Credit card fraud is one of the biggest challenges to financial security in the digital world. According to payments industry research firm [Nilson Report](https://https://nilsonreport.com/), global card losses attributed to fraud reached $33 billion in 2022, affecting consumers, banks and merchants. 

To mitigate this problem, financial institutions are investing significant amounts in prevention technologies, including systems based on artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML).

Despite this effort, the challenge of detecting fraud remains complex. Machine learning techniques need to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, differentiating between false positives (legitimate transactions mistakenly flagged as fraud) and true positives (fraudulent transactions correctly detected). While false positives can result in negative customer experiences, such as having their card blocked while traveling, and damage to the reputation of companies, false negatives, on the other hand, allow fraud to occur.

This critical balance makes the problem particularly challenging and interesting for the application of machine learning techniques.

The data used was extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and contains thousands of credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders.
